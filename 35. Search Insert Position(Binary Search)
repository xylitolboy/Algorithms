#Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:

#Sort the array in ascending order.
#Set the low index to the first element of the array and the high index to the last element.
#Set the middle index to the average of the low and high indices.
#If the element at the middle index is the target element, return the middle index.
#If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index â€“ 1.
#If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index + 1.
#Repeat steps 3-6 until the element is found or it is clear that the element is not present in the array.
